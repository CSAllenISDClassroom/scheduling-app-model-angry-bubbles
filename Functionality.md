# 1. List of Courses

## Functionality
Every possible course will be listed initially, but a search engine will be available to make accessibility of courses more easier by the user. The search engine will receive user input and compare it with the list of courses to filter by keyword. Furthermore, the search engine will also be assisted by filters to further narrow down the list of courses to ones that the user desires. Possible filters to narrow down selections include subject, period, location, GPA, prerequisites, and grade requirements.

# 2. Model Schedule

## Functionality
The model schedule is an empty schedule on the screen that has empty slots for each period. The term "Model Schedule" refers to the user interface displayed on the screen. The user interface for this should look like the interface for the empty schedule in the scheduler app last year (2020-2021). Courses can be dragged into and out of the slots on the model schedule. It will have spots for each period (0-8), but the 0, 1, and 8 period spots will be there for both A days and B days. Furthermore, there will be a a second interface for the second semester, to account for semester long classes.
